## Terraform State

- Maps - Real world resources to Terraform configuration.
- By Default state is stored locally in a file called terraform.state
- Prior to any modification operation, Terraform refreshes the state
- Resources dependency metadata is also tracked via the state file( eg while configuring vpc, subnet should have been configured before)
- helps boost deployment performance by caching resource attributes for subsequent use.
