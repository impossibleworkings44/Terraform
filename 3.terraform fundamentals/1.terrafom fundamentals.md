### variables in terraform

eg : 
```
variable "my-var" {
  description : "my test",
  type : string
  default : "hello"
}
```

- Variables can help you make your code more versatile and readable
- referencing a variable ``` var .myvar ```
- variables can be picked up in a file called ```terraform.tfvars```

### Base Types :
- string
- number
- bool

Complex Types:
 - list, set, map, object, tuple

 eg : 
 ```
 variable "docker_ports" {
 type = list(object({
 	internal = number
 	external = number
 	protocol = string
 }))

 default = [{
 		  internal = 8300
 		  external = 8300
 		  protocol = "tcp"
 	  }]
 }
 
 
```

### terraform provisioners : when to use them
- Terraform Provisioners are used for executing scripts or shell commands on a local or remote machine as part of resource creation/deletion
- within terraform code , each individual resource can have its own provisioners defining the connection method(if reqd such as ssh) and commands/script to execute.
- 2 types of provisioners :
    - Creation-time
    - Destroy-time
 ```
 terraform cannot track changes to provisioners as they can take any independent action , hence they are not tracked by terrraform files
 ```
 - if the command within a provisoner returns  non zero return code , it is considered failed and underlying resource is tainted.

eg of provisioner :
```
//creation - time
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo '0' > status.txt"
  }
  
  //destroy-time
   provisioner "local-exec" {
    when = destroy
    command = "echo '0' > status.txt"
  }
  
```
