## # Understanding Infrastructure As Code

##### IaC and Its Benefits :

- No more clicks
```
Write down what you want to deploy (VMs, disks, apps) as human-readable
```
- Enable DevOps
```
Codification of deployment means it can be tracked in version control enabling better visibility and collaboration across teams
```
- Speed, Cost and Reduced Risks
```
less human intervention during deployment means fewer chances of security flaws, superfluous resources, and more time is saved.
```

####  Terraform (Why you will love it ? )
```
- Automate Software Defined Nwtworking
- Supports vast arrays of public  and private cloud vendors (eg heroku, aws, gcp)
- tracks state of each resource deployed (eg : if the user changes the image of an os terraform automatically removes and deletes the old image, saving physical work and time)
-Terraform doesn't care what cloud or infrastructure deployment method you're using. It works seamlessly with a long (and growing) list of cloud platforms.
