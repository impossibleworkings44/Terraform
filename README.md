# Terraform (https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-hashicorp-certified-terraform-associate-foundations)

<h3>IaC : Infrastructure as Code </h2>(basically) the process of managing and provisioning IT systems through machine readable definition file rather than physically logging into system or using other interactive configuration tools.
<br/>

**Iac Tools :**
- Ansible
- Chef

Terraform keeps tracks of all the resources its deployed for you , so its different from the above three.
- Terraform uses HCL language (Hashicorp Certified Language)
